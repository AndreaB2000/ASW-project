## Introduction

_Sandpiles_ is a project designed to emulate the functionality of online board game platforms, providing an interactive and competitive environment for players of all skill levels to play _Sandpiles_. The platform offers real-time matchmaking, AI-driven opponent, statistics review and match history review.

The _Sandpiles_ game is based on the [Abelian sandpiles mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model). It sees two players face each other head to head in a strategic game with time constrains.

Developed with a focus on usability, performance, and scalability, _Sandpiles_ aims to demonstrate best practices in web application development while delivering an engaging and accessible game experience.
